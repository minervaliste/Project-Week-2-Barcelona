## Project Description
In this project, it was our goal to determine the general immigrant profile for the city of Barcelona. On top of this, we wanted to use the data that we found in order to try and determine any immigration patterns. 

## Questions & Hypotheses
- What is the most common profile of a Barcelona immigrant?
- What are the structures of immigrant clusters in different neighbourhoods (similar nationalities, demo profile, etc)

## Dataset
Started with data provided in the course on immigration linked to nationality, gender and age. Went to open data to get things such as profession, studies etc. but could not find any datasets linked to immigration that included this.

## Database
One table each for nationality, gender and age. One Master table connecting these 3 tables, containing district code, district name, neighbourhood code, neighbourhood name. Neighbourhood code acts the foreign key in the relationships. 

Include a drawing or computer-generated image of the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of your database.

## Workflow
- Search for the right data.
- Import CSV files data into Sequel Pro and Pandas. Analyse the data according to different parameters.
